Enhance my homepage for "COSMIC Pizza & Donair - Canada's Best Halal Pizza & Donair" by adding elegant animation effects to each section.
The design should stay clean and professional, using the content below and highlighting animation in these ways:

Each main section (headers, descriptions, features, specials, menu, locations) should appear with a subtle entrance animation as the user scrolls—such as sliding in from left/right, fading in, or scaling up.

Apply soft hover effects on all buttons, cards, and important content panels to make them visually responsive (e.g., slight scaling, shadow lift, gentle color change).

Keep animations smooth and performance-friendly—avoid loud, jittery, or distracting effects.

Use modern CSS (and JavaScript, if needed) for all animation logic; add comments explaining each effect added.

Ensure all content is clearly readable, arranged with good hierarchy, nice spacing, and welcoming colors.

The site remains responsive and mobile-friendly.

Sample animation ideas:

Section headings fade in and slide up one after another.

Text blocks slide in from alternating sides.

Button hover: slight scale-up and glowing shadow.

Card/menu hover: gentle background lift or color highlight.
